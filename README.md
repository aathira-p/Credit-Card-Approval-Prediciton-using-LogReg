# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediciton-using-LogReg
A python project on predicting the approval for credit cards using logistic regression.

Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, an automatic credit card approval predictor is built  using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
[Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used. This project is referenced from [datacamp](www.datacamp.com)
